DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
---------------------------

The game consists of 2 players. Each player has 4 pawns: 3 archaeologists and a "Theseus" searching for the four great "lost palaces" of the Minoan civilization. 

To reach a lost palace one must travel a path of nine steps. On his turn a player may discard a card (with values ranging from 1 to 10) and move either an archaeologist or Theseus one step. 
The color of the card indicates the path to follow. The player should try to throw a card with a low value at the beginning, since to move the same pawn again he must play a card of equal or higher value. 

Each player should have each of their 4 pawns on a different path, and it is not necessary to use all of their pawns. The object of the game is for each player to get their pawns as far as possible to gain more points. 
The winner is the player who will collect the most points.


CARDS & TRAILS
--------------
25 Cards correspond to each Palace. Using these cards, each player can move one (and only one) of their pawns to the corresponding path only.

--20 Cards with value 1-10 (2 for each value) for each palace.
  Each time the player discards such a card, he moves one step to the corresponding palace. However, the cards must be thrown in ascending order (one cannot throw a card with the number 3 if the last card they threw was a card with the number 4) while ties are also allowed (someone can throw a card with the number 3 on top of a card with number 3).

--3 Ariadne Myth Cards for each palace.
  Each time the player discards such a card, he moves two steps to the corresponding palace. These cards are thrown separately from cards 1-10 and do not affect the order.


--2 Minotaur Cards for each palace.
  Whenever the player discards such a card to the opponent, then the opponent must move 2 steps back to the corresponding palace, unless the opponent's pawn is Theseus, who always counters this attack.


PATH
----
Each Path has 9 steps. The further one reaches, the more points he gets, while if he reaches one of the first three steps, then he has a negative score. At positions 2,4,6,8,9 of each Path there are archaeological findings.


ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGS
----------------------
At positions 2,4,6,8,9 of each path there is an excavation marker where the player can excavate to discover 20 archaeological finds. The 20 finds are placed randomly and are locked in slots. The only limitation is that the 4 rare finds must be randomly located in one of the 5 locations of the corresponding palace where there are archaeological finds.

  --4 Rare Findings
  Discus of Phaistos (Worth 35 Points)
The Discus of Phaistos is randomly placed in one of the 5 locations on the Path of Phaistos. Its value is 35 points. Once the player discovers the Disc, they add it to their collection.
  Ring of Minos (Worth 25 Points)
The ring of Minos is randomly placed in one of the 5 locations on the path of Knossos. Its value is 25 points. Once the player discovers the ring, they add it to their collection.
  Jewel of Malia (Worth 25 Points)
The Jewel of Malia is randomly placed in one of the 5 locations of the path of Malia. Its value is 25 points. Once the player discovers the jewel, they add it to their collection.
  Ryto of Zakros (Worth 25 Points)
The Ryto of Zakros is randomly placed in one of the 5 positions of the path of Zakros. Its value is 25 points. Once the player discovers the ryto, they add it to their collection.

--Statues of the "Snake Goddess"
There are 10 Statues. Each of these is randomly placed in the remaining 16 available slots (the other 4 are filled by the rare finds). When a player reaches such a location, they add such a statue to their collection. His goal is to collect as many statues as he can.

--Fresco
There are 6 fresco that are randomly placed in the remaining available slots. When a player discovers a fresco, they can photograph it. But the frescos don't move from their position (they don't become a player's property), so if the other player passes by the same position, then they can take a photo of it too.



ACTIONS TAKEN ON EACH PLAYERâ€™S TURN
--------------------------------------
Each player's turn consists of 2 phases: 

1st phase: Playing Cards The player can: 
1) either discard a card of a new castle and place a pawn of it on the corresponding path, 
2) either discard a card of an existing palace to move his pawn to the next position on the corresponding path, 
3) either throw a Minotaur card at the opponent, 
4) either discard a card. 

2nd phase: He must take one card from the card pile.



DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ALTERNATIVES OF EACH PHASE
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st Phase:
Playing Cards
--------------

The player chooses a card and does one of the following four actions: 
1. Start path exploration: The player can start exploring a path by discarding a card with a value of 1-10 and choosing which pawn to place there (Theseus or an Archaeologist). Each player can place only one of his pawns on each path, without having to use all of his pawns. 
Clarifications: Both players can be on a certain path. A path cannot be started with a Mitos of Ariadni card. 
2. Continue path exploration: The player can continue a path by discarding a card with a value greater than or equal to the previous one. He can also drop a Mitos of Ariadne card (which does not affect the ascending order). If the player passes by an unexplored dig box, then it is opened (eg the player is informed via a Java Dialog). If it's either a statue or a rare finding, he adds it to his collection (so the other player can't take it). If it's a fresco, he just "photographs" it and the fresco stays there. 
Clarifications: If the player passes through an excavation box via the Mitos of Ariadne card, then they can "excavate" or photograph a fresco.
The Mitos of Ariadne card does not affect the ascending order. Example: If a player has thrown the card 3 for Knossos and then the Mitos of Ariadne card (of Knossos), to proceed again to the next round he can take a card with a value (3 or higher value) or take a new card Mitos of Ariadne. 
If the player is in the penultimate position on the path (slot 8) and discards a Mitos of Ariadne card, they simply move to the last position (slot 9).

3. Attack an opponent with a Minotaur card: The player can drop one Minotaur card to the opponent for a specific palace. The opponent's player moves back 2 steps unless one of the following cases applies. 
1. If the opponent's Theseus is in that particular palace, then he always parries this attack. 
2. The card cannot be used if the opponent has reached (or passed) the seventh step (Check Point) on the given path even with an Archaeologist pawn.
Clarifications: If the opponent is in the first position of the Path, the attack has no value. If it is in the second position of the Path, it simply returns to the first position. 
Because the player can go back and pass a fresco again, he cannot "photograph" it a second time. 
4. Rejection of card: The player discards a card (it is placed in the discard pile).

2nd Phase:
-----------

He must take one card from the card pile. The player takes one card from the card pile (each player must always have 8 cards at the end of each round). 

END OF GAME
-----------

Case (a): when the cards of the Card pile run out. 
Case (b): when at least 4 of any pawns (regardless of player) reach the seventh step (Check Point) on any path, then the game ends. It is not necessary for the pawns to be on 4 different paths nor do they all belong to the same player. A possible case (certainly not the only one) where the game ends is the following: if both players have reached the seventh step of Knossos, 1 player has reached the seventh step of Phaistos and 1 player has reached the seventh step of Malia, and no one has reached the seventh step of Zakros.

Each player's score is a sum of the following: 
1. The score from the frescos he has photographed 
2. Of the score of rare findings he has discovered 
3. The score from the statues he has collected according to the table below:
Num of statues 
	0 	1 	2 	3 	4 	5 	6 	7 	8 	9 	10 
Score 	0 	-20 	-15 	5 	15 	30 	45 	55 	70 	90 	100 

4. Each archaeologist earns as many points as are written on the point of the path he is on (the number can also be negative)
5. Theseus earns twice as many points as those listed on the waypoint he is on (even negative points are doubled) Whichever player has the highest score wins, in case of a tie the following tie criteria apply: 
(a). Whoever has earned the most of the 4 rare finds wins. 
(b). If there is no winner from a) whoever has more murals wins.
(c) If there is no winner from (a), (b) whoever has the most figurines wins.
(d) If no winner emerges from (a), (b), (c) we have a tie.
